# Candidate take-home task

This project contains a simple contact form on the home page of a default project.

# Requirements

The form is located in HomeController.Index.

- Write the POST action for this view. It should trigger an email which would be sent via an existing service in the project.
- Your solution should consider the user experience during an error or success. Ensure that you pay attention to the existing service's implicit input requirements and prevent exceptions from occurring.
- Please make any other changes to the project as you see fit to improve the overall codebase, this includes to the C# code, and to the frontend HTML, CSS and JS.
- Feel free to introduce any libraries you wish to aid you in completing the task to a high standard.
